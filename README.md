# Substitution-Cipher
This C++ project provides a simple implementation of the Substitution Cipher, a classic encryption technique that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a different letter or symbol. The Substitution Cipher is a fundamental concept in cryptography and serves as a great starting point for those interested in learning about encryption methods. This repository contains a well-documented C++ implementation with the capability to both encrypt and decrypt messages using user-defined substitution keys. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or a beginner looking to explore the world of encryption, this project can be an educational resource or a foundation for building more advanced cryptographic tools.
